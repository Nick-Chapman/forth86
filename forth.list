# List of files making up Quarter Forth. These get embedded into _build/kernel.img

# Coing in Quarter (not Forth yet), define a WFX-loop...
f/quarter.q
# Now we have a basic WFX (word-find-execute) loop. There is no ":".

# Now, restart the existing WFX-upwards boot process...
f/boot.f
# Now we have a colon compiler ":" supporting immediate words (but no numerics).

# A few important system words which we define early (before string and dict)
f/early.f

f/string.f
# Now we have string literal syntax; handy for messages!

f/dict.f
# Now we can inspect ("words") and manage ("hide") our dictionary.

# Reference implementations for "s=", "type", "find" and "word".
f/reference.f

# Standard words, without using numerals ( except 0, 1 )
f/standard.f

# Numeric literals and print (.)
f/numbers.f

f/interpreter.f
# Now we are running a working top level interpreter, "[", supporting numerics.
# "exit" and "]" exit back to the kernel WFX-loop; "[" will restart.

f/colon.f
# Now we have a working colon compiler ":" supporting numerics and immediate words.
# And of course allowing nested interpretation with [ ... ].

# Examine stack (.s), memory (mem,dump,xxd); decompiling (see); regression support ("x")
f/tools.f

# f/own-mult.f  # WIP multiplication defined using shift and add

f/examples.f    # various examples
f/primes.f      # compute all 16bit primes
# f/control.f   # fun with return stack operators

# Some regression tests for standard words.
f/regression.f

f/relocate.f

f/term.f # x86 BIOS terminal control
f/snake.f

# Line based keyboard entry, with backspace! (You miss this when you don't have it!)
f/buffer.f

# Displays welcome message, enables echo, and marks startup-is-complete.
f/start.f

# Helpful for dev.
f/play.f
