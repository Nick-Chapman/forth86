Status:

Recoded the forth (outer) interpreter in forth.

Done:
- cleanup Makefile
- just forth in sub dir
- "mem" memory usage reporting (need expose sp address)
- assemble time size reporting
- reorder asm: builtin words at end, so contiguous with run time words
- reorder asm: embedded text just before builtin words (idea: slide to recover space)
- support () comments in forth -- (need key)
- string support: ." s" (need key)
- "type" - the name of the standard forth word to print a string
- find should return an XT (not an entry - 3 bytes to left)
- interpreter: check dict before number? allow numbers to be re-defined !
- colon interpreter in forth
- improve dump.f for standard words see/dump
- recode "words" in forth

Next:

- merge and strip comments to single embedded forth file
- check return under/stack overflow
- refactor builtin words to be in forthy style where possible (and thus candidates for .f)
- strip functionality of asm intepreter/colon-compiler: de-support numbers, immediate
- relative offsets for branch, making code relocation easier.

- ".s" - non destructive show of stack (need to know stack base)
- state aware combined interpreter/colon-compiler in forth, support [, ]
- "quit" - clear return stack and restart interpreter loop
- "abort" - clear param stack and call quit
- support nested parens in comments

- parse buffer - can this be coded in forth? (need backspace detection!)
- allow words to be marked as hidden

- support "else" (factor "ahead" - find posting on control flow imp in forth)
- do/loop -- make F example work using original code
- create
    create X
    X here expect

- >r r>
- postpone
- does>

- bye: is it possible to quit qemu from inside forth?

- macros/defs in prep to explore threaded interpreter
- threaded interpreter: direct or indirect?

- run for real. not in qemu
- port everything to 6502. bbc or own-6502-computer
