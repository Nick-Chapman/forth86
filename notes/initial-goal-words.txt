Initially list of goal words to drive development.
Mainly from starting-forth; a few from jones.

Many numeric words which I am not interested in. Also many "2" and "c" (char) versions of ops which can wait. Also, editor/buffer stuff is out of scope for me.

(later: turns out "c" words are quite important primitives!)
